"""
This script defines an HTTP server that can receive serialised dictionaries and encrypted text
files via HTTP POST requests, and then deserialise and decrypt them respectively. It also provides
options to print and/or save the received contents.

Usage:
    Run the script, and enter "print", "save", or "both" to choose how to process the received
    contents. Send HTTP POST requests to the server's address with a serialised dictionary and
    an encrypted text file in the format specified in the request headers. The script will then
    deserialise and decrypt the received contents, and optionally print and/or save them.
